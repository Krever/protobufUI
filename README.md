# protobufUI
Simple application for testing Google Protocol Buffers APIs. Inspired by SoapUI.

App was created as an university project and is 'univeristy quality', so if life is in danger you probably need some better tool.

Still, it works, allows you to load your .proto files, prepare message(in user friendly form) and send it to the server.

Feel free to do whatever you want with it.
